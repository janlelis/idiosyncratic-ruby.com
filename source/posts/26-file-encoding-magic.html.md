Ruby has [three default encodings](http://graysoftinc.com/character-encodings/ruby-19s-three-default-encodings). One of them is the default [source encoding](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Encoding.html#class-Encoding-label-Script+encoding), which can be set using a **magic comment** in the file's first line, or in the second line if the first line is taken by a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29).

Default source encoding (UTF-8):

    p "".encoding #=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>

With encoding comment (`file_with_magic_comment.rb`):

    # coding: cp1252
    p "".encoding #=> #<Encoding:Windows-1252>

See [Magic Instructions](/58-magic-instructions.html) for more information about magic comments in general.

## Respecting the Encoding Comment when Reading a File

**REMOVED IN RUBY 3.3!**

You might come across a situation, where you want to read in a source file using Ruby's [File](https://ruby-doc.org/core/File.html) class, but also want to set the proper encoding from the magic comment. Fortunately, Ruby's standard library supports this. Unfortunately, it is not a stand-alone module, but a part of IRB:

    >> require 'irb/magic-file'
    # => false
    >> IRB::MagicFile
    # => #<Object:0x00000001a6bb10>
    >> File.open('file_with_magic_comment.rb').read.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
    >> IRB::MagicFile.open('file_with_magic_comment.rb').read.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:Windows-1252>
